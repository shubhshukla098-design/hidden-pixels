## 🔎 Overview

**Hidden Pixels** is a lightweight steganography tool that allows users to secretly embed hidden text messages inside standard image files without noticeably altering the image's appearance. It serves as a practical demonstration of data obfuscation and bit-level image manipulation.

---

## ✨ Features

* **🔒 Imperceptible Encoding:** Hides custom text messages within the Least Significant Bits (LSB) of an image's RGB channels.
* **🔄 Precision Decoding:** Extracts hidden messages from stego-images, stopping automatically when the secret cryptographic delimiter is reached.
* **🛡️ Lossless Output:** Automatically saves output images in `.png` format to ensure hidden data is not destroyed by lossy compression algorithms.
* **⚙️ Dynamic Edge-Case Handling:** Safely handles pixel edge cases, ensuring data is written securely even if the payload bit length isn't a perfect multiple of three.

## 🔬 How it Works (The Math)

This tool utilizes the **Least Significant Bit (LSB) replacement** algorithm. 

Every pixel in a standard image is made of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels, represented by 8-bit integers (ranging from 0-255). By modifying only the *last* bit of these integers, the decimal color value changes by a maximum of 1 unit.

| Channel | Original Value | Original Binary | Payload Bit | New Binary | New Value | Visual Shift |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Red** | `150` | `1001011`**`0`** | **`1`** | `1001011`**`1`** | `151` | None |
| **Green** | `200` | `1100100`**`0`** | **`0`** | `1100100`**`0`** | `200` | None |
| **Blue** | `85` | `0101010`**`1`** | **`0`** | `0101010`**`0`** | `84` | None |

Because the human eye cannot detect such a microscopic shift in color (`±1`), we can safely overwrite these last bits with the binary representation of our secret text. The decoder then walks the exact same path across the image's grid, sweeps up those last bits, and reassembles them back into characters.
